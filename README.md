# **Swan Consulting Project**

Welcome to our Swan Consulting project, we are Team Forest Forecasters!

This repository contains the code and documentation for our predictive modeling project focused on predicting customer churn for SwanTeleco, a fictional telecommunications company.

### Instructions:

1. **FF_SwanTeleco_pt1.ipynb**: Start by reviewing this notebook. It encompasses the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Train-Test Splitting, and implementation of our Logistic Regression model. Additionally, you'll find our predictions based on the finalized Logistic Regression Model in this document.

2. **FF_SwanTeleco_pt2.ipynb**: Proceed to this notebook next. It provides insights into the alternative models we explored but chose not to implement for our final predictions. These models include Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Bagging.
